# CodeSamples
This is a repository of code that I have written traveling a life long path of improving my programming skills.  I worked each problem out by myself; I have not copied other peoples work.  Most of the samples are answers to questions in educational books.  There is also a set of solutions to problems that I found interesting and wanted to work through via code.  Where appropriate, in a file, I will add a brief description of important thoughts that were key to the process.  When I have to reference external information I will note that as well.  If I solve a problem in multiple languages the file name will be the same but the file extension will reflect the language.  Below is a rough index and naming convention for the files in this directory.
